## Changes Made

### 1. Created CurrencyInput Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/form-fields/CurrencyInput.js`
- New reusable component for currency input fields
- Automatically formats values with:
  - Dollar sign ($) prefix
  - Thousand separators (commas)
  - Two decimal places (.00)
- Handles user input intelligently:
  - When focused: Shows raw numbers for easy editing
  - When blurred: Shows fully formatted currency
  - Validates input to allow only numbers and decimal point

### 2. Updated Form Helper Utilities
**File:** `/frontend/src/utils/formHelpers.js`
- Updated `formatCurrency()` to show 2 decimal places instead of 0
- Added `formatCurrencyInput()` - formats numbers with commas and decimals
- Added `parseCurrencyInput()` - converts formatted strings back to numbers

### 3. Updated LoanInformationStep Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/LoanInformationStep.js`
- Replaced number inputs with CurrencyInput for:
  - Loan Amount
  - Property Value
  - Down Payment
- Added `setValue` and `getValues` props
- Updated placeholders to show formatted examples (e.g., "500,000.00")

### 4. Updated BorrowerInformationStep Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/BorrowerInformationStep.js`
- Replaced number inputs with CurrencyInput for Monthly Rent fields
- Applied to both current and prior residences
- Updated placeholder to "1,500.00"

### 5. Updated EmploymentStep Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/EmploymentStep.js`

- Added `setValue` prop
- Updated placeholder to "5,000.00"

**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/AssetsLiabilitiesStep.js`
- Replaced number inputs with CurrencyInput for:
  - Asset Value
  - Monthly Payment (liabilities)
  - Unpaid Balance (liabilities)
  - Property Value (REO)
  - Monthly Rental Income (REO)
  - Monthly Payment (REO)
  - Unpaid Balance (REO)

### 7. Updated ApplicationForm Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/ApplicationForm.js`
- Passed `setValue` and `getValues` props to LoanInformationStep
- Passed `setValue` to EmploymentStep
- Passed `setValue` to AssetsLiabilitiesStep

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Fixed Property Details Step for Refinance
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/PropertyDetailsStep.js`
- **Issue:** Two duplicate buttons appeared for refinance loans
- **Fix:** Consolidated into a single button that shows:
  - "Use Current Residence Address" for Refinance/CashOut
  - "Use Primary Address" for Purchase
- Now only one button appears in the correct context

### 2. Enhanced "Copy to New" Application Feature
**File:** `/frontend/src/pages/ApplicationList.js` and `/frontend/src/components/forms/ApplicationForm.js`
- **Previous Behavior:** Only copied Assets, Liabilities, and REO properties
- **Issue Found:** Raw backend data structure was being copied without proper transformation, causing many fields to not populate correctly
- **New Behavior:** Properly maps backend data structure to form structure and copies ALL fields including:
  - Loan Information (amount, type, purpose, down payment, etc.)
  - Property Details (address, type, construction, year built, etc.)
  - All Borrower Information (personal details with correct field mapping)
  - All Residences (current and prior addresses)
  - Employment History (all employers with income)
  - Income Sources
  - Assets, Liabilities, and REO Properties
  - All Declarations (flattened from nested structure)
- **Key Fixes:**
  - Maps `birthDate` → `dateOfBirth`
  - Maps `dependentsCount` → `dependents`
  - Flattens nested `declaration` object to individual fields
  - Properly handles `property` object nesting
  - Ensures all array data (employment, residences, assets, etc.) copies correctly

### 3. Fixed Default Borrower Initialization
**File:** `/frontend/src/utils/fieldArrayHelpers.js`
- **Issue:** Borrowers started with empty residence and employment arrays, requiring users to manually add entries
- **Fix:** New borrowers now automatically include:
  - One **Current Residence** entry (Primary Address)
  - One **Employment** entry with status "Present"
- **Benefit:** Users can immediately start filling in their current address and employment without clicking "Add" buttons first

### 4. Fixed REO Property Field Labels and Sizing
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/forms/AssetsLiabilitiesStep.js`
- **Issues:**
  - Field labels were missing for REO property monetary fields
  - Currency values like $1,000,000.00 didn't fit properly in inputs
- **Fixes:**
  - Added labels for all REO fields:
    - Property Type
    - Property Value
    - Monthly Rental Income
    - Monthly Payment
    - Unpaid Balance
  - Reduced font size to 85% for labels and inputs
  - Applied smaller font styling consistently across all REO currency fields
- **Result:** Currency values up to $1,000,000.00 now fit comfortably in the input fields

### 5. Enhanced XML Export with MISMO 3.4 Formats
**Files:** `/frontend/src/utils/urlaExport.js` and `/frontend/src/pages/ApplicationList.js`
- **Previous Behavior:** Single "Export XML" button with basic custom XML format
- **New Behavior:** Dropdown menu with two professional MISMO 3.4 standard formats:
  1. **MISMO 3.4 Closing** - Standard closing format
  2. **MISMO 3.4 FNM** - Fannie Mae specific format with additional fields
- **Changes Made:**
  - Created `exportToMISMO34Closing()` - Generates MISMO 3.4 Closing XML with:
    - Proper MISMO namespaces and schema
    - DEAL structure with LOANS, PARTIES, COLLATERALS, LIABILITIES
    - Complete borrower information
    - Employment and income data
    - Property details

    - Complete DECLARATION section with all indicators
    - RESIDENCES with full address history

  - Added click-outside handler to close dropdown
  - File names include format type and application number
- **Benefits:**
  - Industry-standard XML format for mortgage systems
  - Compatible with Fannie Mae and other loan processors
  - Professional, compliant exports

## Display Formatting
The following components already had proper currency display formatting:
- **ApplicationList** - Shows loan amount and property value with formatting
- **ApplicationDetails** - Shows loan amount and property value with formatting
- **ReviewSubmitStep** - Shows all currency values with formatting

## User Experience
- **Input:** Users can type numbers naturally (e.g., "500000" or "500000.50")
- **Display:** Values automatically format when user moves to next field
- **Editing:** Formatting removes when field is focused for easy editing
- **Visual:** Dollar sign ($) appears as a prefix in the input field
