# Form Submission Debugging Guide

## ‚úÖ Backend Status: WORKING PERFECTLY

I tested the backend API directly and it's working 100%:
- ‚úÖ Backend is running on port 8080
- ‚úÖ API endpoint `/api/loan-applications` is responding
- ‚úÖ Successfully created a test application via direct API call
- ‚úÖ Data is being stored in the H2 database
- ‚úÖ GET request returns stored applications

**Test application created:** ID=5, stored successfully and retrievable.

## ‚ùå Issue: Frontend Form Not Reaching Backend

The problem is NOT with the dropzone - that only added document upload functionality.
The issue is the frontend form submission is failing before it reaches the backend.

## üîç How to Debug This

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Press **F12** (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
3. Click the **Console** tab

### Step 2: Fill Out Minimal Form
Fill in ONLY these required fields:
- **Step 1 - Loan Information:**
  - Loan Purpose: Purchase
  - Loan Type: Conventional  
  - Loan Amount: 300000
  - Property Value: 400000

- **Step 2 - Borrower Information:**
  - First Name: Test
  - Last Name: User
  - Email: test@example.com
  
- **Step 3 - Property Details:**
  - Property Address: 123 Test St
  - City: Test City
  - State: CA
  - ZIP: 12345

- **Step 4 - Employment:**
  - Employer Name: Test Corp
  - Position: Tester
  - Start Date: 2020-01-01
  - Employment Status: Present
  - Monthly Income: 5000

- **Skip Steps 5-6** (Assets/Liabilities and Declarations)

- **Step 7 - Review & Submit:**
  - Check both agreement boxes
  - Click **Submit Application**

### Step 3: Check Console Output
Look for these debug messages in order:

1. `[DEBUG] ========== FORM SUBMISSION STARTED ==========`
2. `[DEBUG] Raw form data:` (shows form values)
3. `[DEBUG] Transforming form data to backend DTO structure...`
4. `[DEBUG] Final application data to send:` (shows transformed data)
5. `[DEBUG] Number of borrowers:` and `[DEBUG] Number of liabilities:`
6. `[DEBUG] Calling mortgageService.createApplication...`
7. `[DEBUG] Application created successfully! Response:` (if successful)

OR

`[ERROR]` messages if something failed

### Step 4: Share the Console Output
Copy ALL the console output (especially `[DEBUG]` and `[ERROR]` lines) and share it with me.

## üéØ What I'm Looking For

The console logs will tell me:

1. **Is the submit button being clicked?**
   - If you don't see `[DEBUG] Submit button clicked`, the button isn't working

2. **What data is in the form?**
   - The "Raw form data" log shows what React Hook Form collected

3. **Is the data being transformed correctly?**
   - The "Final application data" shows what we're sending to the backend

4. **Is the API call being made?**
   - Network errors will show as `[ERROR]` with details

5. **What's the exact error?**
   - Backend validation errors will be shown with field names

## üîß Quick Test Via Backend Directly

You can verify the backend works by opening a new terminal and running:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/loan-applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "loanPurpose": "Purchase",
    "loanType": "Conventional",
    "loanAmount": 300000,
    "propertyValue": 400000,
    "status": "DRAFT",
    "property": {
      "addressLine": "123 Test St",
      "city": "Test City",
      "state": "CA",
      "zipCode": "12345",
      "propertyType": "PrimaryResidence",
      "propertyValue": 400000,
      "constructionType": "SiteBuilt",
      "yearBuilt": 2020,
      "unitsCount": 1
    },
    "borrowers": [{
      "sequenceNumber": 1,
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john@test.com",
      "phone": "555-1234",
      "employmentHistory": [],
      "incomeSources": [],
      "residences": [],
      "reoProperties": []
    }],
    "liabilities": []
  }'
```

This should return a successful response with an application number.

## üìä Current Debugging Setup

I've already added extensive logging to:
- `ReviewSubmitStep.js` - Logs when submit button is clicked
- `ApplicationForm.js` - Logs throughout the submission process
- `mortgageService.js` - Logs API calls and responses

All logs use `[DEBUG]` or `[ERROR]` prefixes for easy filtering.
