---

## Technical Details

- Session storage for cross-page data transfer
- Reactive form watching for dynamic UI updates

### User Experience Improvements
- Tab navigation for better organization
- Visual indicators (badges, labels) for clarity
- Automatic field population to reduce data entry
- Real-time filtering and updates

### Code Quality
- ✅ All TypeScript files properly typed
- ✅ No linting errors

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Residence Tabs**: Test adding/removing multiple residences and verify tab navigation
2. **Settings Menu**: Verify dropdown appears, closes on outside click, and rotates smoothly
3. **Self-Employment Docs**: Create application as self-employed with different business types, verify correct tax forms appear
4. **REO Associated Liability**: Add mortgage and secured loan liabilities, verify they appear in REO dropdown
5. **Carry-Over**: Create application with assets/liabilities/REO, use "Copy to New" button, verify data transfers
6. **Declarations**: Check various declaration boxes, verify "Yes" appears below each

---

## Known Considerations

1. **Business Type Mapping**: The form uses "SoleProprietorship" and "Corporation" while the rules engine uses "SoleProp" and "CCorp" - the adapter handles this conversion
2. **Session Storage**: Carry-over data is cleared after being loaded to prevent accidental duplicate loads
3. **Primary Address Only**: The "Use Primary Address" button specifically uses the first (primary) residence address

---

## Future Enhancements (Placeholders Added)

1. **Settings Menu**: Currently shows placeholder - ready for:
   - User preferences
   - Application settings
   - Display options
   - Export/import settings

2. **Mailing Address**: Infrastructure in place but may need additional backend support for separate mailing address handling

---

## Developer Notes

### Component Architecture
- Modular design with separate step components
- Shared form validation and field array hooks
- Centralized document rules engine with TypeScript types

### Form Data Flow
```
User Input → React Hook Form → Validation → 
Form Adapter → Rules Engine → Document Checklist
```

### Carry-Over Flow
```
Application List → Session Storage → 
New Application Form → Form State → Render
```

---

## Deployment Notes

- All changes are frontend-only
- No database migrations required
- No API changes required
- Backend is compatible with all changes
- Existing applications will work without modification
